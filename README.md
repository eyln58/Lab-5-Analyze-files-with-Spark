# ðŸ“Š Data Exploration and Visualization with Azure Synapse Analytics & Spark

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform data exploration, transformation, and visualization using **Apache Spark** within **Azure Synapse Analytics**. The dataset consists of sales order data stored in **Azure Data Lake**, and all processing is done within the **Synapse Studio notebook environment**.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

- **Loaded CSV data from Azure Data Lake into a Spark DataFrame**
  - Used Synapse Studio's interface to quickly load and preview files
  - Defined custom schema for better data clarity

- **Explored data with Spark DataFrame transformations**
  - Selected and filtered records
  - Aggregated data (e.g., total quantities and revenue by year or product)

- **Queried data using Spark SQL**
  - Created temporary views to run SQL queries inside PySpark environment
  - Executed SQL directly with `%sql` magic for data exploration

- **Visualized data**
  - Used built-in Synapse chart options for quick visual feedback
  - Created custom visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` after converting Spark DataFrames to Pandas

## âœ… Outcomes

- Gained experience with **Apache Spark on Azure**
- Demonstrated **seamless integration with Azure Data Lake**
- Used **Spark SQL for analysis in a scalable environment**
- Produced **clear visual insights** from data using both native tools and Python libraries

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

Azure Synapse provides a powerful platform for:
- Distributed data processing with Spark
- Blending SQL and Python workflows
- Quick insights with native visualization support
- Full Python library support for in-depth analysis and plotting
